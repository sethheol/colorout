Description: Colorize R output when it is running on a terminal emulator.
   The functions of this package only work if R is compiled for Unix systems
   and it is running interactively in a terminal emulator. The terminal must
   support Select Graphic Rendition (SGR, also known as ANSI escape codes or
   sequences). The package contains a C library with a function that replaces
   the default Rstd_WriteConsoleEx which, when enabled, is responsible for
   printing messages in the Console when R is running in interactive mode.
   It works with RStudio, but there is no support for Graphical User
   Interfaces that does not support ANSI colors, such as Windows RGui, RKward,
   JGR etc.
