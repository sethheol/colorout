colorout
========

*colorout* is an R package that colorizes R output when running in a Unix
(e.g. Linux and OS X) terminal emulator; it does not work on Microsoft Windows.
The relevant code is written in C and, thus, it runs very quickly and you
should not note any slowdown in R output.

R's `stdout` is parsed and numbers, negative numbers, dates in the standard
format, strings, indices, and R constants are identified and wrapped by special
ansi escape codes that are interpreted by terminal emulators as commands to
colorize the output.

R's `stderr` is also parsed to identify the expressions "warning" and "error"
and their translations to many languages. If these expressions are found, the
output is colorized accordingly; otherwise, it is colorized as "stderror"
(magenta, by default).


### Customization

You can customize the colors according to your preference, guided by the
color table made by the command `show256Colors()`.
You can also set the colors to any arbitrary string. In this case, it is
up to you to set valid values.

You can also call the function `addPattern()` to set your own patterns to be
colorized.

### Installation

You can install the package by running the following commands in a terminal
emulator:

```
git clone https://github.com/jalvesaq/colorout.git
R CMD INSTALL colorout
```

Some people prefer to use
[devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) to
install packages from github.

_NOTES_:

  - The package cannot be on CRAN because it changes code already loaded by R
    and this is prohibited by the *CRAN Repository Policy*. The package
    replaces the functions that output results and messages to R Console, and
    this is necessary because we cannot colorize the output without replacing
    these functions.

  - Because the package is not on CRAN, it is better to load it with
    `require()` rather than `library()` to avoid error in your `~/.Rprofile`
    after upgrading R.
